.SH LEVELS
There are two programs in /usr/lib/jumpnbump to help you make
your own levels: pack and unpack.
.IP pack
.br
/usr/lib/jumpnbump/pack \-o /tmp/newlevel.dat <file1> <file2> <file3> ...
.br
or you can just put all the files in a dir, cd to
that dir and do
.br
/usr/lib/jumpnbump/pack \-o /tmp/newlevel.dat *
.br 
and it will put all the files
in the current dir inside the packfile. Don't try things like 
pack \-o stuff.dat ../file.c because it will add ../file.c as the filename in the packfile, which won't work.
.br
.IP unpack
.br
/usr/lib/jumpnbump/unpack level.dat
.br
will unpack it in the current directory.
.IP gobpack
.br
With gobpack you can convert .gob files (which are sprites, 
described in /usr/share/doc/jumpnbump/gob.txt) into .pcx files 
which you can edit with The Gimp for example, then convert back 
to a .gob and use it in your own level.
.br
/usr/lib/jumpnbump/gobpack \-u font menu.pcx
.br
will unpack font.gob using the color palette from menu.pcx and 
write the files font.pcx font.txt. The other gob files should 
use level.pcx for the correct palette.
.br
/usr/lib/jumpnbump/gobpack font
.br
will generate font.gob from font.pcx and the specifications 
in font.txt. The .pcx files should be resaved with another 
program, as they are not packed and are thus very large.
